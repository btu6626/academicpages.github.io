I am currently applying to graduate programs in biologial and biomedical sciences and engineering. This website contains information about my academic background, research interest, past research experience and personal stories. Links to various academic / social media websites are on the left side panel.

Academic Background
======
I graudated from University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry (with Highest Distinction). In order to be prepared for graduate work involving a combination of experimental and computational approaches, my undergraduate coursework focused on in-depth training in biological and physical sciences as well as statistics and computer science. Although not required, I elected to take 2 semesters of calculus-based physics and a full sequence of general chemistry, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry for chemistry majors. Out of curiosity about the theoretical basis of statistics, I took mathematical statistics I & II, i.e., probability theory and statistical inference. For formal training in computer science, I successfully completed data & algorithm, computer organization and parallel programming. A graduate level survey course in computational biology helped me form a general understand about common applications of computational methods and tools in biological research. I also actively participated in the University Honors Program, which offered excellent educational opportunities in academic writing and public speaking.

Research Interests
======
Since my undergraduate years, I have developed broad interests in the development and application of novel high-throughput technologies and computational methods for biological / biomedical research.

Interest 1
------
Developing novel technologies in single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics and computational methods in dimensionality reduction and data integration

Interest 2
------
Refining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome/epigenome perturbation technologies

Interest 3
------
Probing the regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs experimentally and computationally

Interest 4
------
Applying these technologies to delineate the processes of cell state transition and distinct cell types in neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental anomalies

Research Experience
